  # Though not specified by POSIX, tools (such as `git`, for example)

  # allows PAGER to include extra arguments to be passed to the
  # executable. For compatibility, this also uses `sh` explicitly.

  # Note: we pass the value of `PAGER` itself as `$0`, which is a bit
  # funky, but itâ€™s what `git` does, and it makes some kind of sense.
